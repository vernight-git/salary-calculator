# Security Assessment

## Date: 2025-10-31

## Dependency Vulnerabilities

### Current Status
```
npm audit report shows 5 moderate severity vulnerabilities
```

### Details
All 5 vulnerabilities are in the **esbuild** package, which is a transitive dependency through:
- vite (build tool)
- vitest (test framework)
- @vitest/mocker

### Vulnerability Analysis

**Package:** esbuild <=0.24.2  
**Severity:** Moderate  
**Issue:** esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response  
**CVE:** GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99  

**Risk Assessment:**
- ✅ **Development-only dependency** - Not included in production build
- ✅ **No runtime impact** - esbuild is only used during build/test time
- ✅ **Mitigation:** Development server should not be exposed to untrusted networks
- ⚠️ **Recommendation:** Monitor for updates to vite/vitest that include patched esbuild version

### Production Security Checklist

- ✅ No sensitive data handling (static calculator)
- ✅ No user authentication required
- ✅ No database or backend services
- ✅ Input validation on numeric fields
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ No inline scripts (CSP-friendly)
- ✅ Static file serving only
- ❌ No Content-Security-Policy headers (requires server configuration)
- ❌ No rate limiting (not applicable for static app)
- ❌ No error tracking service configured

### Recommendations

#### Immediate (Before MVP)
1. Document that development server should not be exposed publicly
2. Add CSP headers in server configuration when deploying
3. Monitor npm audit regularly for production dependencies

#### Short Term
1. Wait for vite/vitest updates that include patched esbuild
2. Consider adding error tracking (e.g., Sentry) for production issues
3. Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline

#### Long Term
1. Regular dependency updates (monthly)
2. Automated security scanning in CI/CD
3. Security audit before major releases

### Deployment Security

When deploying to production, ensure:
1. Serve from HTTPS only
2. Add security headers:
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - Strict-Transport-Security
3. Enable CORS only if needed
4. Regular server security updates

### Notes

The calculator performs all calculations client-side. No data is sent to any server. The security risk is minimal for end users, as the vulnerabilities affect only the development environment.
